# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
DU Data Bootcamp: Module 15 - R
## Overview of Project
R is very commonly used in data science for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. More recent updates have extended R's capacity to include generation of machine learning algorithms and other advanced models. Our goal this week is to become comfortable with RStudio and the R language, and then implement some of the basics into a statistical analysis project.

### Purpose of Project
The specific purpose of the challenge is the ascertain production issues for the MechaCar, a fictional prototype of AutosRUs. We will seek to investigate which variables correlate with miles per gallon (mpg) in order to make accurate predictions. We will examine summary statistics regarding the suspension coils, run some tests to determine if certain manufacturing lots are statistically different from standard production ranges, and design a study to compare the MechaCar performance against other vehicles.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<p>Using the entire mileage dataset to evaluate variate relationships and create a linear model yielded vehicle length and ground clearance as the most significant factors <i>in the dataset</i> that impacted mileage <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/model_coefficients.png"> The relationships indicate that there is at least some correlative relationship between the variables and the desired outcome of designing MechaCar to achieve greater mileage (the slope of the line representing the relationship is not zero, and we can reject the null hypothesis).</p>
Is the slope of the model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
<p>What does the model ultimately tell us? Both vehicle length and ground clearance demonstrate a positive correlation to overall mileage, indicating that a longer vehicle design and at least average ground clearance may pay dividends at the gas pump.</p>
Does this model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes efeectively? Why or why not?
